This front end folder will try to maintain the structure of the "public" folder in the standard Express app file structure, 
soas to maintain maximum useablity and ease of integration. It will hopefully be as simple as copying and pasting the files
onto the server and the functionality will be preserved!

The most important thing is that when you go to add these files to
the app, make sure you run the following commands first: 

npm install bootstrap@4.6.0 (this will install the appropriate popper and jQuery plug-ins as well)

This ensures that the correct node modules are downloaded locally on the server!

That's it!
